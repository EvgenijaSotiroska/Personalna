        <p>Cooking is a passion I inherited from my grandparents. Ever since I was 4-5 years old, my grandma
            used to put me on the table so I can help her make some dough for pizza or meatballs for my soup.
            I always feel very fulfilled when I cook. Because I am staying at undergraduate dormitories that doesn't happen
        very often, that's why when I am back in my hometown I try to use the most of the time to cook for my family and friends.</p>

        <p>
            Photographing nature is a hobbie that I recently discovered. Last October, my aunt from Australia came to visit
            Macedonia, so we were visiting a lot of places in our country. I was amazed with the beauties of the nature, and like
            every Gen Z person I had to take photos from everything I see. That became like a habit of mine, and I only
            got better with time. Now, wherever I go, I have to take a lot of picture, just like they say: If there is no picture,
            it didn't happen! Here are some of my faverouite photos from Ohrid:

        <p>
            Me loving books, is a habit that came from my mother. She LOVES books, and has read over 1000 books in her life.
            She always knows what kind of book to recomend to me and I always enjoy them. She also has written two books,
            so you get the idea how important books are to her. One intresting fact about me is that, I either don't read
            books for months, or I read four in one week - and there is no in between. Most of the time I read thrillers, actions
            or mystery, but sometimes when I want to relax, I read romance or comedies.
